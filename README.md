# A controller for your protogen!
### Please read:
- I think it works pretty well right now, if I find any problems/mistakes, I will fix them. Also, if you wanna add something/suggest something, create a issue or pull request!
- I have already seen couple of protos using my code (even on MFF) and I'm happy about it! If you are going use this code for your protogen, I wanna see it! PM me on IG:@NCPlyn
- The code is missing prefab animations (only one so far for the ears), and other couple animations. I will add them once I finish my proto, but if you can, create pull request with your own! Also I'm thinking about remote control using BLE, which can be used with other ESP32 or native android app... but will see.
